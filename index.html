    <p>Chess hasn't been updated in almost 200 years and it's obvious the devs have abandoned it. The greedy creators took your money and laughed all the way to the bank.
I remember back in 705 AD when chess was fun. Then they started adding stupid features no one wanted like "Castling" and "En Passant" instead of listening to player feedback and fixing game-breaking bugs. I've been complaining for YEARS about the collision-detection glitch with the horsey. The "clipping-thru-pieces" bug has been abused to death and the lazy devs refuse to fix it.
Don't support this awful behaviour and boycott this company.</p>

    <p>Is that... ðŸ˜³
Oh no, it can't be, forget it ahah ðŸ˜†
But maybe... ðŸ¤”
Is it possible that you are referring to the very popular manga and anime titled "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"? ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
I know it's a bit of a strech, but I can't stop asking myself if this is the case. ðŸ˜…
Sorry to bother you, have a nice day ðŸ˜Š</p>
